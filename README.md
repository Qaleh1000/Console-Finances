# Console-Finances

JavaScript code that analyses records

The JavaScript code challenged our research and learning abilities. It began by determining the number of months in the dataset, then calculated the average profit/loss changes over the given period. The code's ultimate goal was to find and report the most significant increases and decreases in profit/loss, offering insights into the financial performance trends.
